1 Problem Statement

Current Standards PDF download is buried mid-page with weak conversion. No email nurture sequence exists to convert downloads into licensing prospects or Council applicants.

Gaps:
	1.	Download CTA placement reduces visibility and conversion potential.
	2.	No segmentation between attorneys, families, and other prospects.
	3.	Missing automated nurture sequence to build trust and drive demos.

Result: low email capture rate (~6.5%), poor lead qualification, and missed conversion opportunities.
