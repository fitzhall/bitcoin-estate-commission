PRD-01 â€” "Authority Patch" Launch

Version 1.0 â€“ 2025-07-10
Author: Manus AI (draft for review)
Target release: Week 1 sprint (ship by 2025-07-17)

1 Problem Statement

Early-stage visitors (especially attorneys) land on bitcoinestatecommission.org and ask:
"Who exactly is behind this? Why should I trust it?"

Gaps:
	1.	Hero copy claims "500+ attorneys" with zero proof, triggering skepticism.
	2.	Council bios & founder credentials are absent, creating credibility vacuum.
	3.	Quotations / stats appear without citations, risking false-endorsement claims.

Result: lower email conversions, higher bounce, and ammunition for "crypto hype" dismissal.

2 Objective + KPI

Objective: Establish immediate perceived legitimacy so attorneys feel safe downloading the Standards and joining the waitlist.

Avg. time on homepage	~35s	> 60s

3 User Stories
	1.	Attorney Jessica arrives via Google, skims hero, and within 5 seconds understands this is a neutral standards body (not just a vendor) â†’ she clicks Download Draft Standards.
	2.	Journalist Evan researching "Bitcoin inheritance standards" sees named experts + source links and cites the commission without fact-checking hurdles.
	3.	Prospective council lawyer sees an explicit "Council seats open" panel and submits the interest form instead of exiting.
