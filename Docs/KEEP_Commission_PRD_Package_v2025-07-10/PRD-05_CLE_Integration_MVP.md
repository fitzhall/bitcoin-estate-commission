1 Problem Statement

Certification program requires complex CLE accreditation across 50 states, LMS development, and ongoing compliance management. Building in-house would distract from core licensing product and delay market entry.

Gaps:
	1.	No CLE accreditation expertise or state filing capabilities in-house.
	2.	LMS development requires significant engineering resources and ongoing maintenance.
	3.	Directory integration needs verified completion tracking and automated updates.

Result: delayed certification launch, resource drain from core business, and potential compliance issues.
