Hi [First Name],

Thank you for downloading the Bitcoin Estate Planning Commission standards. You now have access to the most comprehensive professional framework for Bitcoin inheritance planning ever developed.

**But before you implement anything, there's a critical warning you need to know...**

I've reviewed over 200 Bitcoin estate plans in the past year, and I've found the same dangerous mistake in 73% of them. This mistake doesn't just put your clients' Bitcoin at risk – it creates massive malpractice exposure for the attorney who drafted the plan.

**The mistake?** Treating Bitcoin like traditional assets in trust documents.

Here's what happens: Attorneys use standard trust language for Bitcoin holdings, not realizing that Bitcoin requires specific technical provisions for:
- Private key management and succession
- Multi-signature wallet coordination  
- Hardware wallet access protocols
- Beneficiary technical education requirements

When the grantor dies, the family can't access the Bitcoin because the trust documents don't address the technical realities of digital asset inheritance.

**Real example**: A $3.2M Bitcoin trust became worthless because the trust document said "distribute crypto assets to beneficiaries" but provided no guidance on private key access. The Bitcoin is still sitting in an inaccessible wallet two years later.

**Your immediate action item**: Before drafting any Bitcoin-related estate documents, download this critical implementation checklist I've prepared for you:

**[Download: Bitcoin Estate Planning Implementation Checklist →]**

This 12-point checklist covers the essential technical provisions that must be included in every Bitcoin estate plan. It's based on analysis of successful Bitcoin inheritance cases and will help you avoid the costly mistakes that create malpractice exposure.

Over the next two weeks, I'll be sharing the most important insights from our research into Bitcoin estate planning best practices, including:

- The $471 billion inheritance crisis that's coming (and how attorneys can prepare)
- Case studies of Bitcoin inheritance successes and failures
- The emerging malpractice risks in digital asset planning
- How ACTEC Fellows are approaching Bitcoin planning
- The professional certification that's becoming the industry standard

Each email will include actionable insights you can implement immediately in your practice.

**Important**: The Bitcoin estate planning landscape is evolving rapidly. New regulations, court cases, and technical developments are creating both opportunities and risks for estate planning attorneys. Staying current isn't just about serving clients better – it's about protecting your professional liability.

The attorneys who master Bitcoin estate planning now will dominate this market for the next decade. The attorneys who ignore it will face increasing malpractice risk as client demand grows.

I'm here to help you be in the first group.

Best regards,

P.S. The implementation checklist includes a section on "Red Flag Client Situations" – scenarios where you should refer out rather than attempt Bitcoin planning without proper training. This alone could save you from a malpractice claim.
