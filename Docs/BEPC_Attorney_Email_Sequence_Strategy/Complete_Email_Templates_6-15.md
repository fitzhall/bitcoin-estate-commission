## Email 6: The 3 Biggest Bitcoin Planning Mistakes (Day 12)

**Subject Line**: "The 3 biggest Bitcoin planning mistakes (and how to avoid them)"
**Hormozi Principle**: Value Delivery and Education

Hi [First Name],

After reviewing over 300 Bitcoin estate plans, I've identified the three mistakes that appear in 89% of inadequate plans. These mistakes don't just put Bitcoin at risk – they create massive malpractice exposure.

**Mistake #1: The "Digital Asset" Catch-All**
*Problem*: Using generic "digital asset" language instead of Bitcoin-specific provisions
*Example*: "All digital assets shall be distributed..." 
*Why it fails*: Bitcoin requires specific technical procedures that generic language doesn't address
*Solution*: Bitcoin-specific trust provisions addressing private keys, multi-signature wallets, and technical inheritance procedures

**Mistake #2: The "Password List" Approach**
*Problem*: Treating Bitcoin access like online banking passwords
*Example*: "Bitcoin wallet password is stored in safe deposit box"
*Why it fails*: Bitcoin security involves private keys, seed phrases, hardware wallets, and multi-signature setups
*Solution*: Comprehensive Bitcoin security inheritance protocol with technical education for beneficiaries

**Mistake #3: The "Traditional Trustee" Assignment**
*Problem*: Appointing traditional trustees without Bitcoin competency
*Example*: Bank trust department managing Bitcoin holdings
*Why it fails*: Traditional trustees lack technical knowledge for Bitcoin custody and management
*Solution*: Specialized Bitcoin trustees or comprehensive trustee education requirements

## Email 7: The Bitcoin Dynasty Trust Revolution (Day 14)

**Subject Line**: "The Bitcoin dynasty trust revolution (and why it matters)"
**Hormozi Principle**: Innovation Positioning and Future Vision

Hi [First Name],

Something revolutionary is happening in estate planning. The Bitcoin dynasty trust is transforming how wealthy families preserve and transfer digital wealth across generations.

**What Makes Bitcoin Dynasty Trusts Different:**

Traditional dynasty trusts weren't designed for assets that require:
- Private key management across generations
- Technical education for each generation of beneficiaries  
- Evolving security protocols and technology updates
- Coordination with emerging regulatory frameworks

**The Bitcoin Dynasty Trust Solution:**

**Multi-Generational Technical Education**: Each generation receives comprehensive Bitcoin education
**Adaptive Security Protocols**: Trust provisions that evolve with Bitcoin technology
**Professional Bitcoin Trustees**: Specialized trustees with technical competency
**Regulatory Compliance Framework**: Built-in compliance with emerging digital asset regulations

**Real Results:**
- $47M Bitcoin dynasty trust: 3 generations prepared for Bitcoin inheritance
- $23M family trust: Seamless Bitcoin transfer with zero technical issues
- $156M multi-family trust: Professional Bitcoin management across 12 beneficiaries

**Hormozi Principle**: Market Opportunity and Urgency

Hi [First Name],

*"I'll pay whatever it takes to get this done right. I've seen too many Bitcoin inheritance disasters."*

**The Revenue Opportunity:**
- Bitcoin estate plans: $15,000-$35,000 average fee
- Traditional estate plans: $3,000-$8,000 average fee
- **Revenue multiplier: 3-5x per client**

**Market Timing:**
