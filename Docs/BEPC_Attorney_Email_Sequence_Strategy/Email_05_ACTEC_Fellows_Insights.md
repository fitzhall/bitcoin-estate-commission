Hi [First Name],

Last week, I had coffee with three ACTEC Fellows to discuss Bitcoin estate planning. What they told me was both surprising and revealing about where the industry is heading.

**The conversation started with skepticism...**

**Fellow #1**: "I've been doing estate planning for 30 years. Bitcoin feels like a fad that will pass."

**Fellow #2**: "My clients ask about it, but I tell them to keep it simple and stick with traditional assets."

**Fellow #3**: "I'm worried about the liability. What if I give bad advice about something I don't understand?"

**But then something interesting happened...**

**The Reality Check**

I shared some data that changed the conversation:

- 47% of millionaires now own cryptocurrency
- Average crypto allocation among high-net-worth clients: 8.3%
- Projected Bitcoin inheritance volume by 2030: $2.1 trillion
- Current attorney preparedness level: 3% feel "very confident"

**Fellow #1's response**: "Wait, nearly half of millionaires? I had no idea it was that widespread."

**Fellow #2**: "8.3% allocation? That's significant money we're talking about."

**Fellow #3**: "If only 3% of attorneys are confident, that's a massive professional liability issue."

**The Conversation Shifted**

What happened next was fascinating. These three experienced ACTEC Fellows started sharing their own Bitcoin experiences:

**Fellow #1**: "Actually, I have a client with $4 million in Bitcoin. I've been avoiding the conversation because I don't know how to plan for it properly."

**Fellow #2**: "I lost a $15 million client last month. He said he needed an attorney who understood cryptocurrency planning. I had to refer him out."

**Fellow #3**: "My malpractice carrier asked specific questions about crypto planning on my renewal. I realized I'm exposed if I handle it wrong."

**The Industry Consensus is Emerging**

Here's what these ACTEC Fellows concluded:

**"Bitcoin planning isn't optional anymore. It's becoming a core competency."**

**Fellow #1**: "I need to get educated on this. My clients are asking, and I can't keep saying 'I don't know' to millionaire clients."

**Fellow #2**: "The referral I made last month? That attorney charged $25,000 for the Bitcoin estate plan. I gave away a huge fee because I wasn't prepared."

**Fellow #3**: "I'm more worried about the liability of NOT learning this than the liability of learning it properly."

**What Other Industry Leaders Are Saying**

I've had similar conversations with estate planning leaders across the country. Here's what they're telling me:

**Margaret Chen, ACTEC Fellow, San Francisco**:
*"Bitcoin estate planning is where tax planning was in the 1980s – emerging as essential expertise. The attorneys who master it now will dominate the high-net-worth market."*

**Robert Martinez, Past President, State Bar Estate Planning Section**:
*"We're seeing a fundamental shift. Clients expect their estate attorney to understand Bitcoin. If you don't, they'll find someone who does."*

**Sarah Thompson, 25-year Estate Planning Veteran**:
*"I was skeptical until I lost three clients in six months to attorneys who offered Bitcoin planning. Now I'm getting certified because I can't afford to lose more."*

**The Professional Development Arms Race**

Here's what's happening in the industry:

**Major Law Firms**: Hiring Bitcoin specialists and sending partners to cryptocurrency training

**Boutique Practices**: Differentiating through Bitcoin expertise and charging premium fees

**Solo Practitioners**: Getting certified to compete with larger firms for crypto-wealthy clients

**Bar Associations**: Developing Bitcoin CLE requirements and professional standards

**The Early Adopter Advantage is Real**

The attorneys who are getting Bitcoin certified now are seeing:

- **Premium fee opportunities**: $5,000-$25,000+ per Bitcoin estate plan
- **Client attraction**: Bitcoin expertise draws high-net-worth clients
- **Referral networks**: CPAs and financial advisors referring Bitcoin clients
- **Market differentiation**: Standing out in a crowded estate planning market

**But the window is closing.**

**The Tipping Point is Coming**

Industry adoption follows a predictable pattern:

**Phase 1 (2020-2023)**: Early adopters get trained, capture early market
**Phase 2 (2024-2025)**: Mainstream adoption, competitive advantage diminishes  
**Phase 3 (2025+)**: Standard competency, no longer differentiating

**We're at the end of Phase 1, entering Phase 2.**

**The attorneys who act now get the early adopter advantage. The attorneys who wait will be playing catch-up.**

**What the ACTEC Fellows Decided**

By the end of our conversation, all three Fellows had made the same decision:

**Fellow #1**: "I'm getting Bitcoin certified. I can't afford to keep referring out million-dollar clients."

**Fellow #2**: "I need to understand this properly. The liability of ignorance is greater than the liability of competence."

**Fellow #3**: "My clients deserve better than 'I don't know.' I'm getting the training I need to serve them properly."

**The Question for Your Practice**

If ACTEC Fellows – the most experienced estate planning attorneys in the country – are recognizing the need for Bitcoin competency, what does that mean for your practice?

**Three options:**

1. **Ignore Bitcoin planning** and hope it goes away (it won't)
2. **Refer out Bitcoin clients** and lose fees and relationships
3. **Get properly trained** and capture the opportunity

**The choice is yours, but the market is deciding for you.**

**Tomorrow, I'll share the three biggest Bitcoin planning mistakes that even experienced attorneys make – and how to avoid them.**

These mistakes are costing attorneys clients, fees, and professional credibility.

P.S. One ACTEC Fellow told me: "I wish I had started learning about Bitcoin planning two years ago. I'd be $200,000 ahead in fees and wouldn't have lost those clients." Don't let this be your regret.
