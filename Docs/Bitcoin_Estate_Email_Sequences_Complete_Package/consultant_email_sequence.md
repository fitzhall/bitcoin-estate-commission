**Preheader:** Why smart advisors are adding Bitcoin estate planning to their practice

---

Hi [First Name],

Your Bitcoin Estate Planning Standards are attached.

But before you dive in, let me share something that might change how you think about your business...

**There's a $47 billion market that most advisors don't even know exists.**

Bitcoin estate planning.

**Here's what's happening:**

Right now, there are approximately 50 million Americans who own Bitcoin. The average holding is worth $23,000.

Do the math: That's $1.15 trillion in Bitcoin wealth.

But here's the kicker: **Less than 3% of Bitcoin owners have proper estate planning.**

That means $47 billion in Bitcoin inheritances are going to fail in the next decade. Families will lose everything. Not because of market crashes or bad investments.

**Because of poor planning.**

**The Advisor Opportunity:**

Smart financial advisors, CPAs, and consultants are positioning themselves as the Bitcoin estate planning experts in their markets.

They're not becoming crypto traders or investment advisors. They're simply adding Bitcoin inheritance planning to their existing practice.

**The results are staggering:**

- Average engagement fee: $8,500 (vs. $3,200 for traditional estate planning)
- Client retention: 94% (vs. 67% industry average)
- Referral rate: 340% higher than traditional services
- Competitive differentiation: Immediate (most advisors avoid Bitcoin entirely)

**Why This Works:**

Bitcoin owners are desperate for professional guidance. They know they need help, but they don't know where to find it.

Most financial advisors won't touch Bitcoin. Most estate attorneys don't understand it. Most CPAs are terrified of it.

**That creates a massive opportunity for the advisors who do understand it.**

**Your Quick-Start Strategy:**

1. **Position yourself as the Bitcoin estate planning expert** in your market
2. **Use the Standards as your credibility foundation** (you're now ahead of 97% of advisors)
3. **Add Bitcoin inheritance planning** to your service menu
4. **Charge premium fees** for specialized expertise
5. **Watch your practice transform** as Bitcoin clients seek you out

**The best part?** You don't need to become a Bitcoin expert overnight. The Standards give you everything you need to get started.

Tomorrow, I'll show you exactly how three advisors used this strategy to add $200K+ to their annual revenue in less than 6 months.

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - The Bitcoin estate planning market is still early. Most advisors don't even know it exists yet. But that window is closing fast. The advisors who establish themselves as experts now will own this market for the next decade.

**Preheader:** How a CPA in Denver became the go-to Bitcoin estate expert

---

Hi [First Name],

Let me tell you about Marcus Chen.

Marcus is a CPA in Denver. 15 years of experience. Good practice. Steady clients.

But he was stuck. Same services, same fees, same competition. He was basically running a commodity business.

Then he discovered Bitcoin estate planning.

**6 months later, he'd added $240,000 in new revenue.**

Here's exactly how he did it:

**Month 1: Positioning**
Marcus downloaded the Bitcoin Estate Planning Standards (just like you did). He spent two weeks studying them. Then he updated his website, LinkedIn profile, and marketing materials to position himself as "Denver's Bitcoin Estate Planning CPA."

**Month 2: Content Marketing**
He started writing weekly LinkedIn posts about Bitcoin estate planning. Simple stuff: "5 Bitcoin Tax Mistakes That Cost Families Millions," "Why Your CPA Needs to Understand Bitcoin Inheritance."

The posts went viral in the local business community. Bitcoin owners started reaching out.

**Month 3: First Clients**
His first Bitcoin estate planning client was a software engineer with $180,000 in Bitcoin. Marcus charged $4,500 for a comprehensive Bitcoin estate plan (vs. his usual $1,200 for traditional tax planning).

The client was thrilled. Referred three friends.

**Month 4-6: Scale**
Word spread fast. Marcus became known as "the Bitcoin CPA" in Denver. He raised his fees to $6,500 per engagement. Still had a waiting list.

**By month 6:**
- 28 Bitcoin estate planning clients
- Average fee: $8,500
- Total new revenue: $240,000
- Referral rate: 89% (his traditional practice was 23%)

**The best part?** Marcus didn't become a Bitcoin trader or investment advisor. He stayed in his lane. He just added Bitcoin estate planning expertise to his existing tax and accounting practice.

**His Secret Weapon: The Standards**

Marcus told me: "The Standards gave me instant credibility. When I could reference specific protocols and cite the Commission's research, clients knew I was the real deal. I went from 'CPA who knows a little about Bitcoin' to 'the Bitcoin estate planning expert' overnight."

**The Implementation Strategy That Works:**

**Week 1-2: Study the Standards**
Don't try to become a Bitcoin expert overnight. Focus on the estate planning aspects. Understand the common failure points. Learn the key terminology.

**Week 3-4: Update Your Positioning**
Revise your marketing materials. Add "Bitcoin Estate Planning" to your service menu. Update your LinkedIn profile. Create a simple landing page.

**Week 5-6: Content Marketing**
Start sharing Bitcoin estate planning insights. LinkedIn posts, blog articles, local speaking opportunities. Position yourself as the expert.

**Week 7-8: First Clients**
You'll start getting inquiries. Price your services as premium expertise (2-3x your normal rates). Bitcoin clients expect to pay more for specialized knowledge.

**Month 2+: Scale and Systematize**
Develop your Bitcoin estate planning process. Create templates. Build referral relationships with Bitcoin-savvy attorneys and financial advisors.

**The Market Timing is Perfect:**

Bitcoin estate planning is exactly where traditional estate planning was 20 years ago. Huge demand, limited supply of qualified professionals.

The advisors who get in now will dominate this market for decades.

**Want to see Marcus's exact implementation playbook?** I'm hosting a live case study session next week where he'll walk through his entire strategy.

**[Register for the Live Case Study â†’]**

Limited to 100 advisors. Marcus will share his marketing templates, fee structures, client onboarding process, and answer your specific questions.

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - Marcus's biggest regret: "I wish I'd started sooner. The market was even less competitive 6 months ago. But there's still plenty of opportunity for advisors who move fast."

**From:** Bitcoin Estate Planning Commission <standards@bitcoinestatecommission.org>  
**Subject:** Partner with Us: Bitcoin Estate Planning Certification  
**Preheader:** Become a Certified Bitcoin Estate Planning Professional (limited spots)

Hi [First Name],

I'm going to be direct with you.

After seeing what advisors like Marcus Chen have accomplished with Bitcoin estate planning, we've decided to formalize our training and certification program.

**The Bitcoin Estate Planning Professional (BEPP) Certification.**

It's designed for financial advisors, CPAs, and consultants who want to dominate the Bitcoin estate planning market in their area.

**Here's what makes this different:**

This isn't just another online course. It's a complete business transformation system.

**What You Get:**

**1. Comprehensive Training Program**
- 40 hours of video training on Bitcoin estate planning
- Live Q&A sessions with industry experts
- Case study library with 50+ real scenarios
- Technical deep-dives on Bitcoin custody and inheritance

**2. Marketing and Positioning System**
- Done-for-you marketing templates
- LinkedIn content calendar
- Website copy and landing pages
- Local market domination strategy

**3. Client Delivery Framework**
- Step-by-step client onboarding process
- Fee structure and pricing guidance
- Contract templates and engagement letters
- Client education materials

**4. Ongoing Support and Updates**
- Monthly expert calls
- Quarterly Standards updates
- Private community of certified professionals
- Direct access to Commission experts

**5. Certification and Credibility**
- Official BEPP designation
- Commission endorsement
- Directory listing on our website
- Referral opportunities from the Commission

**The Investment:**

The full BEPP Certification program is $4,997.

But here's the thing: Marcus Chen made that back in his first two clients.

Most certified professionals recover their investment within 30 days.

**Why We're Limiting This:**

We're only accepting 50 advisors in the first cohort. 

Why? Because we want to ensure quality. We want to work closely with each certified professional. We want to make sure everyone succeeds.

**Plus, market exclusivity matters.** If we certify 500 advisors in Denver, none of them will dominate the market. But if we certify 2-3 in each major market, they'll own it.

**The Application Process:**

This isn't for everyone. We're looking for serious professionals who:
- Have an established practice (minimum 3 years)
- Serve affluent clients (household income $200K+)
- Are committed to becoming the Bitcoin estate planning expert in their market
- Can invest the time to complete the certification (6-8 weeks)

**If that sounds like you, let's talk.**

I'm doing 15-minute qualification calls this week. No sales pitch. Just an honest conversation about whether BEPP is right for your practice.

**[Schedule Your Qualification Call â†’]**

**What Happens on the Call:**

I'll ask about your current practice, your goals, and your market. You can ask about the program, the time commitment, and the expected ROI.

If we're both excited about working together, I'll invite you to join the first cohort.

If not, no hard feelings. I'll point you toward resources that might be a better fit.

**The Bottom Line:**

The Bitcoin estate planning market is exploding. The advisors who establish themselves as experts now will own this space for decades.

You can try to figure it out on your own. Or you can partner with the organization that literally wrote the standards.

**Your choice.**

**[Schedule Your Qualification Call â†’]**

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - We start the first BEPP cohort on [Date]. If you want to be part of it, we need to talk this week. After that, you'll have to wait for cohort 2 (which won't start until [Date + 6 months]).
