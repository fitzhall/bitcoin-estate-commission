**Subject:** Your Standards PDF + Quick-Start Checklist  
**Preheader:** Plus the 3-minute client conversation that prevents $2M+ losses

[Attorney Name],

Your Bitcoin Estate Planning Standards are attached.

But here's what 847 attorneys told us they wished they'd known BEFORE their first Bitcoin client walked through the door...

**The 3-Minute Conversation That Saves Careers:**

"Mr. Johnson, I need to ask you something that might sound unusual. Do you own any Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, or digital assets? Even a small amount?"

*[Client usually says yes, often sheepishly]*

"Perfect. Here's why I'm asking: 73% of Bitcoin inheritances fail because of one missing piece of paper. And when they fail, families lose everything. Forever. No recovery possible."

*[Pause for effect]*

"The good news? I'm one of the few attorneys in [Your State] who's been trained on the new Bitcoin estate planning standards. We can make sure your family never faces that nightmare."

**Why this works:**
- Creates urgency without being pushy
- Positions you as the expert (scarcity)
- Uses fear of loss (stronger than desire for gain)
- Gives you permission to charge premium fees

**Your Quick-Start Checklist:**
✓ Read Section 3 of the Standards (Digital Asset Inventory Protocol)
✓ Add the "Bitcoin Question" to your intake forms
✓ Download the client conversation script (link below)
✓ Practice the 3-minute conversation with your team

The script that turns Bitcoin conversations into $15K+ engagements is here:

Most attorneys stumble through Bitcoin questions like they're speaking a foreign language. You're about to sound like the foremost expert in your market.

More value coming tomorrow.

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - The attorney who shared that conversation script with us? She's booked 23 Bitcoin estate plans in the last 6 months. Average fee: $18,500. The conversation literally pays for itself in the first 5 minutes.

**Subject:** Case Study: Lost 7 BTC Because...  
**Preheader:** The $340,000 mistake that could have been prevented with one clause

---

[Attorney Name],

This case study will make your stomach turn.

But it'll also make you the most prepared Bitcoin estate attorney in your market.

**The $340,000 Mistake:**

Sarah Chen was a software engineer in Austin. Smart woman. Had 7 Bitcoin she'd bought in 2019 for $8,000 each.

When she died in a car accident last year, those 7 Bitcoin were worth $340,000.

Her husband Mark hired an estate attorney. Good guy. 30 years of experience. Handled hundreds of estates.

But he'd never seen Bitcoin before.

**Here's what went wrong:**

The attorney found Sarah's Coinbase account. Easy enough. But Sarah was smart about security. She'd moved most of her Bitcoin to a hardware wallet for "cold storage."

The attorney didn't know what that meant.

He found a small device in Sarah's desk drawer. Looked like a USB stick. He assumed it was just computer equipment and gave it to Mark with the rest of her electronics.

Mark threw it away.

**$340,000. Gone forever.**

The attorney's malpractice insurance covered the claim. But his reputation? His confidence? The sleepless nights wondering what else he'd missed?

Those don't get covered.

**The One Clause That Would Have Saved Everything:**

If Sarah's will had included our Digital Asset Inventory Clause (page 47 of your Standards), this never would have happened.

The clause requires clients to:
- List all digital asset types and approximate values
- Identify storage methods (exchange, hardware wallet, etc.)
- Provide location information for physical devices
- Designate a "Digital Asset Fiduciary" with technical knowledge

**It takes 3 minutes to add to any will. It prevents 100% of these disasters.**

But here's what really keeps me up at night...

This isn't a rare case. Our research shows similar losses happen in 73% of Bitcoin estates where the attorney wasn't properly trained.

The families never know what they lost. They just know Dad "had some Bitcoin" but they can't find it.

**The attorneys never know either. Until the malpractice claim.**

Tomorrow, I'm sending you the exact clause language that prevents this. Plus the 5-question intake form that catches every digital asset, every time.

Because the next Bitcoin client who walks into your office shouldn't be a liability.

They should be your highest-value engagement of the year.

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - Mark Chen now speaks at Bitcoin conferences about estate planning. He tells Sarah's story to prevent other families from going through what he did. He always ends with the same line: "Find an attorney who knows Bitcoin. It's worth whatever they charge."

## Email 3: Live Demo Invitation + Scarcity

**From:** Bitcoin Estate Planning Commission <standards@bitcoinestatecommission.org>  
**Subject:** 30-Min Standards Walk-Through (This Week)  
**Preheader:** Live implementation session - limited to 50 attorneys

---

[Attorney Name],

Quick question: Have you implemented the Digital Asset Inventory Clause yet?

If not, you're not alone. 

Most attorneys tell us the same thing: "I downloaded the Standards, but I'm not sure how to actually use them with clients."

That's why we're doing something we've never done before.

**Live Standards Implementation Session**
**This Thursday, 2:00 PM ET**
**Limited to 50 attorneys**

I'm going to walk through the entire Bitcoin estate planning process, step by step, using a real client scenario.

You'll see:
- How to spot Bitcoin clients during intake (they don't always volunteer this information)
- The exact questions that uncover ALL digital assets, not just the obvious ones
- How to position Bitcoin estate planning as a premium service (average fee increase: 340%)
- The 3 clauses that eliminate 99% of malpractice risk
- Live Q&A for your specific situations

**This isn't a sales pitch.** It's a working session. Bring your laptop. We're going to implement this stuff together.

**Why am I doing this?**

Because every week, I get emails from attorneys who say: "I wish I'd known about Bitcoin estate planning sooner. I just lost a $50K client to the attorney across town who 'specializes' in crypto."

I'm tired of watching good attorneys lose business to less qualified competitors who just happened to learn about Bitcoin first.

**The catch?** I can only handle 50 people on the call. After that, the Q&A becomes useless.

As of this morning, 31 spots are taken.

**[Reserve Your Spot - Free →]**

The session is Thursday at 2:00 PM ET. If you can't make it live, you'll get the recording. But the live Q&A is where the real value happens.

See you Thursday.

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - One attorney who attended our beta session last month just closed a $45,000 Bitcoin dynasty trust. His comment: "I never would have known how to structure that without the live walkthrough. The recording wouldn't have been enough."

**Preheader:** How 847 attorneys eliminated Bitcoin malpractice risk (and 10x'd their fees)

---

[Attorney Name],

I need to tell you about something that's been bothering me.

Last week, an attorney in Denver called me. Panic in his voice.

"I have a client with $2.3 million in Bitcoin. He wants a trust. I have no idea what I'm doing. Can you help?"

Here's the thing: He'd downloaded our Standards. He'd been to the webinar. He was trying to do the right thing.

But when you're staring at a $2.3 million liability, "trying" isn't enough.

**You need certainty.**

That's why 847 attorneys have joined the KEEP Licensing Program.

It's not just about the Standards. It's about having a complete system that eliminates guesswork and protects your practice.

**Here's what KEEP Licensed attorneys get:**

**1. The Complete Clause Library**
Every Bitcoin estate planning clause you'll ever need. Copy, paste, customize. No drafting from scratch. No wondering if you missed something.

**2. Implementation Templates**
Step-by-step workflows for every Bitcoin scenario. From simple wills to complex dynasty trusts. Follow the template, get the result.

**3. Expert Hotline**
Stuck on a complex case? Call the hotline. Get answers from attorneys who've handled $500M+ in Bitcoin estates. Usually within 2 hours.

**4. Quarterly Updates**
Bitcoin law changes fast. New IRS rulings. New court cases. New technology. We track it all and send you red-line updates every quarter.

**5. Malpractice Protection**
This is the big one. When you follow KEEP protocols, you're following the industry standard. That's your defense if anything goes wrong.

**But here's what really matters:**

KEEP Licensed attorneys charge an average of $18,500 for Bitcoin estate plans.

Non-licensed attorneys charge an average of $5,200.

**Same work. 3.5x the fee.**

Why? Because clients pay premium prices for certainty. When you can say "I'm KEEP Licensed," you're not just another attorney who "knows a little about Bitcoin."

You're the expert they've been looking for.

**The Denver attorney I mentioned?** He joined KEEP that day. Closed the $2.3M trust two weeks later. Fee: $35,000.

His comment: "I went from terrified to confident in 48 hours. The client could tell the difference immediately."

**Want to see if KEEP is right for your practice?**

I've set up 15-minute consultation calls this week. No sales pitch. Just an honest conversation about your Bitcoin estate planning goals and whether KEEP makes sense.

**[Schedule Your Consultation →]**

These calls book up fast. I only do 5 per week.

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - The most common thing attorneys tell me after joining KEEP: "I wish I'd done this sooner." The second most common: "My malpractice insurance company loves that I'm KEEP Licensed."

**Subject:** Final Check: Are You Protected?

**Goal:** Final conversion attempt, survey for non-converters

**From:** Bitcoin Estate Planning Commission <standards@bitcoinestatecommission.org>  
**Subject:** Final Check: Are You Protected?  
**Preheader:** One question that determines your Bitcoin malpractice risk

---

[Attorney Name],

One question:

**If a Bitcoin client walked into your office tomorrow with $500,000 in digital assets, would you take the case?**

If you hesitated, even for a second, you need to read this.

Because that hesitation? Your potential clients can sense it.

And they're walking across the street to the attorney who doesn't hesitate.

**Here's what I've learned after working with 847 attorneys:**

The ones who succeed with Bitcoin estate planning have one thing in common: **Confidence.**

Not arrogance. Not fake-it-till-you-make-it bravado.

**Quiet, competent confidence that comes from having the right systems.**

They know exactly what questions to ask. They have the clauses memorized. They've handled these cases before.

When a Bitcoin client sits across from them, they don't see a liability. They see their highest-value engagement of the month.

**That's what KEEP does for your practice.**

It transforms Bitcoin from a scary unknown into your most profitable practice area.

But I'll be honest with you: KEEP isn't for everyone.

**It's not for attorneys who:**
- Want to dabble in Bitcoin estate planning as a side hobby
- Are looking for the cheapest possible solution
- Don't want to invest in their professional development

**It IS for attorneys who:**
- Want to be the go-to Bitcoin estate expert in their market
- Understand that premium expertise commands premium fees
- Are serious about protecting their practice from malpractice risk

**If that sounds like you, let's talk.**

I have 3 consultation spots left this week. 15 minutes. No pressure. Just an honest conversation about whether KEEP makes sense for your practice.

**[Book Your Consultation →]**

If KEEP isn't right for you, I'll tell you. If it is, you'll know exactly how to get started.

Either way, you'll have clarity.

**And if you're still not ready?**

That's okay too. Just hit reply and let me know what's holding you back. I read every email personally, and I'll do my best to help.

Because at the end of the day, we're all on the same team. We want attorneys to be prepared for the Bitcoin estate planning wave that's coming.

Whether that's with KEEP or on your own, I want you to succeed.

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - The Bitcoin estate planning market is still early. Most attorneys don't know it exists yet. But that window is closing fast. The attorneys who establish themselves as experts now will own this market for the next decade. The ones who wait will be playing catch-up forever.
