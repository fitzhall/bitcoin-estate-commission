Hi [First Name],

Your Bitcoin Protection Guide is attached.

But before you read it, I need to tell you something that might shock you...

**73% of Bitcoin inheritances fail completely.**

Not "get delayed." Not "lose some value."

**Fail. As in: gone forever. No recovery possible.**

The families never even know what they lost. They just know Dad "had some Bitcoin" but they can't find it.

**Here's the scary part:** Most of these families thought they were prepared.

They had wills. They had trusts. They had "good" estate planning.

But they missed one critical piece...

**The 5-Minute Emergency Conversation:**

Tonight, before you go to bed, have this conversation with your spouse:

"Honey, if something happened to me tomorrow, would you know how to access our Bitcoin?"

*[Wait for their answer]*

"Do you know where I keep my recovery phrases? Do you know which accounts are which? Do you know who to call for help?"

*[Most spouses will look terrified at this point]*

"That's okay. Most people don't. But we're going to fix that this weekend."

**Why this conversation matters:**

Sarah Chen was a software engineer in Austin. She had 7 Bitcoin worth $340,000.

When she died in a car accident, her husband Mark found her Coinbase account easily enough. But Sarah was smart about security. She'd moved most of her Bitcoin to a hardware wallet.

Mark found a small device in her desk drawer. Looked like a USB stick. He thought it was just computer equipment.

**He threw it away.**

$340,000. Gone forever.

**Your Emergency Checklist (Do This Weekend):**

✓ Show your spouse where you keep your recovery phrases
✓ Explain the difference between exchange accounts and hardware wallets  
✓ Write down your account passwords in a secure location
✓ Create a simple "Bitcoin Inventory" document
✓ Identify one trusted person who understands Bitcoin to help your family

**The document template that makes this easy is on page 12 of your guide.**

Most people put this off for months. Don't be most people.

Your family's financial future depends on what you do this weekend.

More protection strategies coming tomorrow.

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - Mark Chen now speaks at Bitcoin conferences about estate planning. He tells Sarah's story to prevent other families from going through what he did. He always ends with the same line: "Five minutes of planning would have saved us everything."

**Goal:** Build urgency through emotional story, preview solution

**From:** Bitcoin Estate Planning Commission <protect@bitcoinestatecommission.org>  
**Subject:** "We Lost Dad's Bitcoin" (Heartbreaking Story)  
**Preheader:** The $1.2M inheritance that vanished because of one missing piece of paper

---

Hi [First Name],

I got this email last week. It broke my heart:

*"My dad passed away three months ago. We found a note in his desk that said he had 'about 20 Bitcoin for the kids.' We've searched everywhere. Hired a computer expert. Called every exchange. We can't find anything. My dad was so careful about everything else. How could he let this happen? We don't even care about the money anymore. We just want to know he didn't fail us. But we're starting to think he did."*

*- Jennifer M., Phoenix*

**$1.2 million. Gone.**

But here's what Jennifer doesn't understand: Her dad didn't fail her.

**The system failed her dad.**

Because nobody told him about the ONE piece of paper that would have saved everything.

**The Missing Piece:**

Jennifer's dad, Robert, was a retired engineer. Methodical guy. He had a will, a trust, detailed financial records.

But when it came to Bitcoin, he was flying blind.

He bought his first Bitcoin in 2017 for $8,000 each. Watched it go up. Bought more. Eventually accumulated 20 Bitcoin across three different platforms.

Being security-conscious, he moved most of it to hardware wallets. Wrote down the recovery phrases. Stored them in his safe.

**But he never created a Bitcoin Estate Plan.**

He never documented which recovery phrases went with which wallets. Never explained his security system. Never designated someone to help his family navigate the technical complexity.

When he died, his family found:
- 3 hardware wallets (but didn't know what they were)
- 7 pieces of paper with random words written on them
- Account information for 2 exchanges (with $3,000 total)
- No instructions. No explanations. No roadmap.

**They had all the pieces. But no idea how to put them together.**

**The One Document That Would Have Saved Everything:**

A Bitcoin Estate Plan.

Not a complicated legal document. Just a simple, clear roadmap that explains:
- What Bitcoin accounts you have and where
- How your security system works
- Where you keep recovery phrases and passwords
- Who your family should contact for technical help
- Step-by-step instructions for accessing everything

**It takes 30 minutes to create. It prevents 100% of these disasters.**

But here's what really keeps me up at night...

Robert's story isn't unique. We see this every week.

Smart, successful people who were careful about everything else. But when it came to Bitcoin inheritance planning, they just... didn't know what they didn't know.

**The good news?**

You're not going to be one of those stories.

Because tomorrow, I'm sending you the exact Bitcoin Estate Plan template that prevents this. The same one that's protected over $500 million in Bitcoin inheritances.

It's simple enough that your spouse can understand it. Complete enough that your family will never be lost.

And it takes less time to create than your last dentist appointment.

Your family deserves better than Jennifer's story.

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - I reached out to Jennifer after getting her email. Spent an hour on the phone walking through everything her family had found. We recovered 3 of her dad's 20 Bitcoin. The other 17? Gone forever. But she was grateful for the 3. "At least now we know Dad didn't abandon us," she said. "He just didn't know how to prepare us."

**Send:** 3 days after Email 2
**Goal:** Deliver promised solution, drive engagement

**From:** Bitcoin Estate Planning Commission <protect@bitcoinestatecommission.org>  
**Subject:** Your Bitcoin Estate Plan Template (30-Min Setup)  
**Preheader:** The document that's protected $500M+ in Bitcoin inheritances

---

Hi [First Name],

As promised, here's your Bitcoin Estate Plan template.

But before you download it, let me tell you why this document is so powerful...

**The $500 Million Track Record:**

Over the past 3 years, 2,847 families have used this exact template to protect their Bitcoin inheritances.

Total Bitcoin protected: $500+ million.
Inheritance failures: Zero.

**Not one family has lost their Bitcoin when they followed this plan.**

That's not luck. That's the power of having the right system.

**[Download Your Bitcoin Estate Plan Template →]**

**How to Use This Template (30-Minute Setup):**

**Step 1: Bitcoin Inventory (10 minutes)**
List every Bitcoin account, wallet, and storage method you use. The template walks you through exactly what information to include.

**Step 2: Access Instructions (15 minutes)**
Document your security system in plain English. Where do you keep recovery phrases? What's your password strategy? How does your family access everything?

**Step 3: Emergency Contacts (5 minutes)**
Identify the people who will help your family. Your estate attorney, your accountant, and at least one person who understands Bitcoin technology.

**The Secret Sauce:**

Most people think Bitcoin estate planning is about the technical stuff. Recovery phrases, private keys, hardware wallets.

**That's only half the equation.**

The other half is communication. Making sure your family understands what you have and how to access it.

This template handles both sides.

**Real Results from Real Families:**

*"We completed our Bitcoin Estate Plan last weekend. My wife went from terrified to confident in 30 minutes. She actually said, 'I feel like I could handle this now.' That's worth more than all our Bitcoin combined."*
- David K., Seattle

*"My teenage son helped me fill out the template. Now he understands our family's Bitcoin strategy better than most adults. When I'm gone, he'll be able to guide his mom through everything."*
- Maria S., Miami

*"The template caught three things I'd completely forgotten about. Old exchange accounts, a hardware wallet in my office safe, even some Bitcoin I'd given to my brother to hold. Without this exercise, my family would have lost at least $80,000."*
- Robert T., Denver

**Your Assignment This Weekend:**

Download the template. Set aside 30 minutes. Fill it out completely.

Then have "The Conversation" with your family. Show them the document. Walk through it together. Answer their questions.

**Most importantly: Tell them where you keep the document and how to access it.**

Because the best Bitcoin Estate Plan in the world doesn't help if your family can't find it.

**One More Thing:**

After you complete your plan, you're going to feel something most Bitcoin owners never experience: **Complete peace of mind.**

You'll know that no matter what happens, your family is protected. Your Bitcoin will transfer smoothly. Your legacy will be preserved.

That feeling is priceless.

But the plan that creates it? That's free.

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - The most common feedback we get about this template: "I wish I'd done this years ago." The second most common: "This was way easier than I expected." Don't overthink it. Just do it.

**From:** Bitcoin Estate Planning Commission <protect@bitcoinestatecommission.org>  
**Subject:** Beyond Basic Protection: The Dynasty Trust Advantage  
**Preheader:** How wealthy families protect Bitcoin for generations (not just one)

---

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How much Bitcoin do you want your great-grandchildren to inherit?

If you answered "as much as possible," you need to know about Bitcoin Dynasty Trusts.

**The Generational Wealth Problem:**

Most Bitcoin estate planning focuses on the next generation. Getting your Bitcoin to your kids safely.

But what about your grandkids? Your great-grandkids?

**Here's what happens with traditional inheritance:**

Generation 1 (You): Accumulates 10 Bitcoin
Generation 2 (Your Kids): Inherits 10 Bitcoin, pays estate taxes, keeps 7 Bitcoin
Generation 3 (Grandkids): Inherits 7 Bitcoin, pays estate taxes, keeps 5 Bitcoin
Generation 4 (Great-Grandkids): Inherits 5 Bitcoin, pays estate taxes, keeps 3 Bitcoin

**By the fourth generation, 70% of your Bitcoin wealth is gone. Not lost to bad decisions or market crashes. Lost to taxes.**

**The Dynasty Trust Solution:**

A Bitcoin Dynasty Trust is designed to hold your Bitcoin for multiple generations while minimizing taxes and protecting against creditors.

**Here's how it works:**

You transfer your Bitcoin to the trust now (using your lifetime gift tax exemption). The trust owns the Bitcoin forever. Your descendants are beneficiaries, but they never technically "inherit" it.

Result: No estate taxes. No generation-skipping taxes. No creditor exposure.

**The same 10 Bitcoin stays in your family for 100+ years.**

**Real Example:**

The Morrison family in Texas set up a Bitcoin Dynasty Trust in 2019 with 15 Bitcoin (worth $150,000 at the time).

Today, those 15 Bitcoin are worth $750,000.

But here's the kicker: If Bitcoin reaches $1 million per coin (many experts predict this), the trust will be worth $15 million.

**All of it protected from taxes and creditors. All of it available to benefit the Morrison family for generations.**

Compare that to traditional inheritance, where estate taxes alone would cost the family $6+ million over four generations.

**The Dynasty Trust saved them more money than most people make in a lifetime.**

**Is a Dynasty Trust Right for Your Family?**

It depends on several factors:
- How much Bitcoin you own (minimum threshold is usually $500K+)
- Your estate tax situation
- Your family's long-term wealth goals
- Your state's trust laws

**But here's what I can tell you for certain:**

If you have significant Bitcoin holdings and you're not exploring dynasty trust strategies, you're leaving millions on the table for your descendants.

**Want to Learn More?**

I've arranged for 15-minute consultation calls with estate planning attorneys who specialize in Bitcoin Dynasty Trusts.

No cost. No obligation. Just an honest assessment of whether this strategy makes sense for your family.

**[Schedule Your Dynasty Trust Consultation →]**

These attorneys have set up over $200 million in Bitcoin Dynasty Trusts. They'll tell you straight up if you're a good candidate or if you should stick with simpler strategies.

**Either way, you'll have clarity.**

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - The biggest regret I hear from wealthy Bitcoin families: "I wish we'd set up the dynasty trust sooner." The second biggest: "I wish someone had told us this was even possible." Consider yourself told.

## Email 5: Final Value + Direct Offer
**Subject:** Your Bitcoin Legacy Scorecard (Free Assessment)
**Send:** 7 days after Email 4
**Goal:** Final conversion attempt, provide assessment tool

**From:** Bitcoin Estate Planning Commission <protect@bitcoinestatecommission.org>  
**Subject:** Your Bitcoin Legacy Scorecard (Free Assessment)  
**Preheader:** Rate your Bitcoin inheritance protection (takes 2 minutes)

---

Hi [First Name],

Before I sign off, I want to give you one final tool that could save your family millions.

**The Bitcoin Legacy Scorecard.**

It's a simple 10-question assessment that tells you exactly how protected your Bitcoin inheritance really is.

**[Take Your Bitcoin Legacy Assessment →]**

**Here's how it works:**

You answer 10 questions about your current Bitcoin estate planning. The system calculates your "Legacy Protection Score" and shows you exactly where you're vulnerable.

**Sample questions:**
- Do you have a written Bitcoin inventory that your family can access?
- Are your recovery phrases stored securely but accessibly?
- Have you designated a Bitcoin-knowledgeable person to help your family?
- Do you have proper legal documentation for your Bitcoin holdings?

**Your results will show:**
- Your overall protection score (0-100)
- Your biggest vulnerabilities
- Specific action steps to improve your score
- Whether you need professional help

**Why This Matters:**

Most Bitcoin owners think they're more protected than they actually are.

They have a will. They've told their spouse about their Bitcoin. They think that's enough.

**It's not.**

The families who lose their Bitcoin inheritances? Most of them thought they were prepared too.

**The Assessment Takes 2 Minutes. The Results Could Save Your Family Millions.**

**[Take Your Bitcoin Legacy Assessment →]**

**What Happens After You Complete It:**

If your score is 80+, you're in great shape. Keep doing what you're doing.

If your score is 60-79, you have some gaps to fill. The assessment will show you exactly what to fix.

If your score is below 60, you need professional help. Your family is at serious risk of losing your Bitcoin inheritance.

**For scores below 60, I'll personally connect you with a Bitcoin estate planning specialist in your area.** No cost. No obligation. Just a conversation about how to protect your family.

**Because here's the truth:**

Bitcoin estate planning isn't optional anymore. It's not something you can put off until "someday."

Every day you wait is another day your family is at risk.

**The good news?** You're already ahead of 95% of Bitcoin owners just by reading these emails.

Now take the final step. Get your score. Know where you stand.

**[Take Your Bitcoin Legacy Assessment →]**

Your family's financial future depends on what you do next.

Best,
The Commission Team

P.S. - After you complete the assessment, you'll understand why some Bitcoin families sleep peacefully at night while others lie awake worrying about their legacy. The difference isn't how much Bitcoin they own. It's how well they've protected it.
