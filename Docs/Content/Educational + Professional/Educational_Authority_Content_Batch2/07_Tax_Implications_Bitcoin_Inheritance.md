## Bitcoin Tax Fundamentals

> 💰 **Tax Reality**: The IRS treats Bitcoin as property, not currency. This creates both challenges and opportunities for inheritance planning.

Bitcoin taxation is complex and evolving. Understanding the tax implications is essential for effective inheritance planning and wealth preservation.

**Core Tax Principles:**
- **Property Treatment**: Bitcoin is taxed as property, not currency
- **Basis Step-Up**: Inherited Bitcoin receives stepped-up basis
- **Valuation Challenges**: Fair market value determination can be complex
- **Reporting Requirements**: Comprehensive documentation and reporting needed

### Current Tax Framework

**IRS Guidance on Bitcoin:**
- **Notice 2014-21**: Establishes Bitcoin as property for tax purposes
- **Revenue Ruling 2019-24**: Clarifies hard fork and airdrop treatment
- **Form 1040 Question**: Requires disclosure of virtual currency transactions
- **Evolving Guidance**: Ongoing development of tax rules and regulations

| **Tax Type** | **Bitcoin Treatment** | **Key Considerations** |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Income Tax | Capital gains/losses | Holding period, basis calculation |
| Estate Tax | Fair market value inclusion | Valuation, exemption planning |
| Gift Tax | Fair market value transfer | Annual exclusion, lifetime exemption |
| Generation-Skipping | Property transfer | GST exemption allocation |

## 🏛️ Estate Tax Considerations

### Estate Tax Inclusion

**Bitcoin in Your Estate:**
- **Full Inclusion**: All Bitcoin owned at death included in taxable estate
- **Fair Market Value**: Valued at date of death or alternate valuation date
- **Exemption Application**: Protected by federal estate tax exemption ($12.92M in 2023)
- **State Variations**: State estate taxes may apply at lower thresholds

### Valuation Challenges

**Bitcoin Valuation Issues:**
- **Price Volatility**: Significant price fluctuations affect valuation
- **Exchange Variations**: Different exchanges show different prices
- **Timing Issues**: Exact time of death valuation requirements
- **Professional Valuation**: May require qualified appraisal for large holdings

### Estate Tax Planning

**Minimizing Estate Tax Impact:**
- **Lifetime Gifting**: Remove appreciation from estate through gifts
- **Trust Strategies**: Use trusts to minimize estate tax exposure
- **Valuation Discounts**: Potential discounts for lack of marketability
- **Charitable Strategies**: Charitable giving to reduce taxable estate

### Annual Exclusion Gifts

- **Regular Gifting**: Systematic annual gifting program

### Lifetime Exemption Planning

**Strategic Use of Lifetime Exemption:**
- **Current Exemption**: $12.92 million lifetime gift exemption (2023)
- **Sunset Provision**: Exemption scheduled to decrease in 2026
- **Use-It-or-Lose-It**: Potential benefit of using exemption before reduction
- **Generation-Skipping**: Coordinate with GST exemption planning

## 📊 Income Tax Implications

### Stepped-Up Basis Benefits

- **Capital Gains Elimination**: Eliminates built-in capital gains at death
- **Planning Opportunity**: Hold appreciated Bitcoin until death for tax efficiency
- **Partial Step-Up**: Gifts receive carryover basis, not stepped-up basis

### Income Tax Planning

**Optimizing Income Tax Treatment:**
- **Holding Period**: Long-term vs. short-term capital gains treatment
- **Harvesting Losses**: Realize losses to offset gains
- **Charitable Giving**: Donate appreciated Bitcoin to avoid capital gains
- **Installment Sales**: Spread gain recognition over multiple years

### Trust Income Taxation

**Trust Tax Considerations:**
- **Grantor Trust Status**: Income taxed to grantor during lifetime
- **Non-Grantor Trust**: Trust pays income taxes on undistributed income
- **Distribution Deduction**: Trusts deduct income distributed to beneficiaries
