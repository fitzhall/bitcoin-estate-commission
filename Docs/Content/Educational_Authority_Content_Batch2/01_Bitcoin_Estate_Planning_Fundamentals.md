## Why Bitcoin Estate Planning Matters

> üí° **Reality Check**: Without proper planning, your Bitcoin dies with you. No bank. No customer service. No recovery options.

Bitcoin inheritance isn't like traditional assets. When you die, your Bitcoin doesn't automatically transfer to your heirs. There's no institution managing the transition, no customer service to call, and no legal process that can recover lost access.

**The Hard Truth:**
- **20% of all Bitcoin** is permanently lost due to poor key management
- **$500+ billion** in digital assets lack proper inheritance planning
- **Zero recovery options** exist for improperly planned Bitcoin estates

### What Makes Bitcoin Different

Traditional assets have institutional safeguards. Bitcoin has you.

| **Traditional Assets** | **Bitcoin** |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Banks manage access | You control private keys |
| Legal system can recover | No recovery if keys are lost |
| Institutions facilitate transfer | Technical knowledge required |
| Established legal precedents | Evolving legal landscape |

**Bottom Line**: Bitcoin estate planning isn't optional‚Äîit's essential for protecting your family's financial future.
