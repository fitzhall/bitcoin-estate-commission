## Frequently Asked Questions

### Legal Framework Questions

**Q: How does California's RUFADAA affect my Bitcoin estate planning?**

A: California's RUFADAA (Probate Code §§ 870-884) provides your executor and trustee with clear legal authority to access and manage your Bitcoin holdings. The law uses a three-tier system: first respecting your specific directions, then following your estate planning documents, and finally providing default legal authority. This ensures your Bitcoin can be properly administered while respecting your privacy preferences.

**Q: Can I use a California trust to hold Bitcoin for multiple generations?**

A: Yes, California allows perpetual trusts that can hold Bitcoin indefinitely. These trusts provide excellent asset protection and can avoid generation-skipping transfer taxes while preserving Bitcoin wealth for multiple generations. California's progressive trust laws make it an excellent jurisdiction for long-term digital asset planning.

**Q: What happens to my Bitcoin if I die without a will in California?**

A: Bitcoin follows California's intestacy laws like other property, passing to your spouse and children according to statutory formulas. However, without proper planning, your heirs may face significant challenges accessing encrypted wallets and private keys, potentially resulting in permanent loss of your Bitcoin holdings.

**Q: Do I need special licensing for my Bitcoin holdings in California?**

A: Personal Bitcoin ownership doesn't require licensing. However, if you engage in money transmission activities, operate an exchange, or provide custody services, you may need licensing from the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Estate planning should consider any business activities that might trigger licensing requirements.

### Tax Planning Questions

**Q: How does California tax inherited Bitcoin?**

A: California has no state estate tax or inheritance tax. Inherited Bitcoin receives a stepped-up basis to fair market value at death, eliminating capital gains tax for beneficiaries. However, federal estate tax may apply if the estate exceeds $13.61 million (2024), making federal estate planning important for high-value Bitcoin holdings.

**Q: How does California tax Bitcoin capital gains?**

A: California taxes Bitcoin capital gains as ordinary income at rates up to 13.3% (plus 1% Mental Health Services Tax on income over $1 million). This makes California one of the highest-tax states for Bitcoin gains, making tax planning strategies like charitable giving, installment sales, and timing of realization essential.

**Q: Can I gift Bitcoin to my children to reduce federal estate taxes?**

A: Yes, Bitcoin gifts can use the federal annual exclusion ($18,000 per recipient in 2024) and lifetime exemption ($13.61 million in 2024). California doesn't impose gift tax, so properly structured gifts can reduce your federal taxable estate without state tax consequences.

**Q: Should I consider moving from California to reduce Bitcoin taxes?**

A: Residency planning can provide significant tax savings for high-income Bitcoin holders. States like Nevada, Texas, and Florida have no state income tax. However, California has strict residency rules, and the decision should consider all factors including business, family, and lifestyle considerations beyond just tax savings.

### Professional Services Questions

**Q: Why should I choose a BEPC certified attorney for Bitcoin estate planning in California?**

A: BEPC certification ensures your attorney has specialized knowledge of Bitcoin technology, security, and estate planning integration. Given California's complex regulatory environment and high tax rates, specialized expertise is essential for effective planning. BEPC certified attorneys understand both the technical and legal aspects of Bitcoin estate planning.

**Q: How much should I expect to pay for Bitcoin estate planning in California?**

A: Costs vary based on complexity, but comprehensive Bitcoin estate planning typically ranges from $15,000 to $75,000 for high-net-worth clients. This investment is usually justified by tax savings, risk reduction, and proper asset protection. Simple plans may cost $7,500-$20,000.

**Q: Do I need professional custody for my Bitcoin in California?**

A: Professional custody isn't legally required but is often recommended for significant holdings, especially in trust structures. California hosts many institutional-grade custody providers offering advanced security and compliance capabilities. The decision depends on your holdings size, technical expertise, and risk tolerance.

**Q: How do I coordinate my Bitcoin planning with my startup equity and other tech investments?**

A: California attorneys experienced in tech industry planning can coordinate Bitcoin with startup equity, stock options, and other technology investments. This includes timing strategies for liquidity events, tax optimization across asset classes, and integrated wealth management approaches.

### Security and Implementation Questions

**Q: How should I store my Bitcoin private keys for estate planning purposes?**

A: Best practices include using hardware wallets, multi-signature setups, and secure backup procedures. Your estate plan should include detailed instructions for accessing wallets while maintaining security. Professional custody may be appropriate for significant holdings or complex family situations.

**Q: What information should I include in my California estate planning documents about Bitcoin?**

A: Include wallet addresses, exchange accounts, hardware wallet locations, and access procedures. Avoid including private keys directly in documents. Instead, reference secure storage locations and provide detailed instructions for authorized access. California's RUFADAA supports this approach by respecting your specific directions.

**Q: How often should I update my Bitcoin estate plan in California?**

A: Review your plan annually or whenever you make significant changes to your Bitcoin holdings. Technology evolution, regulatory changes, and family circumstances may require plan updates. California's dynamic tech environment makes regular professional review particularly important.

**Q: How do I coordinate my Bitcoin planning with Proposition 13 property tax benefits?**

A: California estate planning can coordinate Bitcoin transfers with Proposition 13 benefits for real estate. This includes timing strategies for parent-child transfers, trust planning that preserves property tax benefits, and integrated wealth transfer approaches that optimize both Bitcoin and real estate planning.
