## Frequently Asked Questions

### Legal Framework Questions

**Q: How does Florida's digital assets law affect my Bitcoin estate planning?**

A: Florida's Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (Chapter 740) provides your personal representative and trustee with clear legal authority to access and manage your Bitcoin holdings. The law prioritizes your specific directions, then follows your estate planning documents, and provides default authority as needed. This ensures your Bitcoin can be properly administered according to your wishes.

**Q: Can I use a Florida dynasty trust to hold Bitcoin for multiple generations?**

A: Yes, Florida allows dynasty trusts to continue for up to 1,000 years, making them excellent for Bitcoin wealth preservation across many generations. Florida dynasty trusts provide strong asset protection, tax efficiency, and professional management capabilities for long-term Bitcoin holdings.

**Q: What makes Florida attractive for Bitcoin estate planning compared to other states?**

A: Florida offers unique advantages including no state income tax, no estate tax, no inheritance tax, unlimited homestead exemption, business-friendly cryptocurrency regulations, and a growing crypto ecosystem centered in Miami. This creates one of the most favorable environments in the nation for Bitcoin estate planning.

**Q: How does Florida's homestead exemption work with Bitcoin planning?**

A: Florida's unlimited homestead exemption protects your primary residence from creditors, which can be coordinated with Bitcoin planning for comprehensive asset protection. This allows you to maintain a protected residence while holding Bitcoin in trust structures for additional protection and tax efficiency.

### Tax Planning Questions

**Q: How does Florida tax inherited Bitcoin?**

A: Florida has no state estate tax, inheritance tax, or income tax. Inherited Bitcoin receives a stepped-up basis to fair market value at death with no state tax consequences. Only federal estate tax may apply if the estate exceeds $13.61 million (2024), making Florida ideal for Bitcoin estate planning.

**Q: What are the tax advantages of establishing Florida residency for Bitcoin holders?**

**Q: Can I gift Bitcoin to my children without Florida state tax consequences?**

A: Yes, Florida has no gift tax, so Bitcoin gifts are subject only to federal rules. You can use the federal annual exclusion ($18,000 per recipient in 2024) and lifetime exemption ($13.61 million in 2024) without any state tax complications.

**Q: How should I coordinate my Bitcoin planning with retirement planning in Florida?**

Your estate plan should include detailed instructions for accessing wallets while maintaining security. Florida's business-friendly environment provides additional options for professional custody and security services.

**Q: What information should I include in my Florida estate planning documents about Bitcoin?**
