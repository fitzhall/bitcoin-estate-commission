- **Complex Families**: Multiple generations, geographic distribution, varying capabilities
- **Professional Requirements**: Fiduciary oversight, regulatory compliance, audit trails
- **Business Integration**: Corporate holdings, partnership structures, institutional management
- **Risk Mitigation**: Protection against sophisticated attacks and insider threats

### Advanced Configuration Options

**Sophisticated Multisig Architectures:**

| **Configuration** | **Security Level** | **Best For** | **Complexity** |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| 3-of-5 | Very High | Large families, institutional | High |
| 2-of-4 with backup | High | Professional oversight | Medium |
| Nested multisig | Maximum | Ultra-high value | Very High |
| Tiered access | Variable | Complex organizations | High |
