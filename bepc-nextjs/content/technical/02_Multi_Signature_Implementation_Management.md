## Multi-Signature Fundamentals

Multi-signature (multisig) technology provides the foundation for secure Bitcoin estate planning by distributing control among multiple parties while maintaining operational efficiency.

### Technical Architecture

**Script-Based Implementation**
- Bitcoin Script enables flexible signature requirements
- M-of-N schemes require M signatures from N total keys
- Common configurations: 2-of-3, 3-of-5, 5-of-7
- Native SegWit (P2WSH) provides optimal efficiency

**Cryptographic Security**
- Each key independently generated and secured
- No single point of failure for key compromise
- Mathematical proof of authorization required
- Threshold cryptography principles applied

> **Professional Insight**: Multi-signature wallets eliminate single points of failure while maintaining practical usability for estate planning scenarios.

### Estate Planning Applications

**Trustee Distribution Models**
- Client holds one key for operational control
- Professional trustee holds backup key
- Family member or institution holds third key
- Geographic distribution enhances security

**Operational Flexibility**
- Daily transactions require subset of signatures
- Emergency procedures activate additional keys
- Succession planning built into key distribution
- Professional oversight maintains compliance

### Summary Box: Multisig Advantages
✅ **Eliminates single points of failure**  
✅ **Distributes control among trusted parties**  
✅ **Maintains operational efficiency**
