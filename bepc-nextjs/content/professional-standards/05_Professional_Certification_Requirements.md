# Professional Certification Requirements
**Official BEPC Three-Level Certification Framework for Bitcoin Estate Planning Excellence**

---

## Introduction to BEPC Professional Certification

The Bitcoin Estate Planning Commission Professional Certification Program establishes the definitive credentialing framework for practitioners specializing in Bitcoin and digital asset inheritance planning. Developed in collaboration with ACTEC Fellows, Big-Four accounting firm crypto directors, and leading estate planning practitioners, this three-level certification structure ensures that certified professionals possess the knowledge, skills, and expertise necessary to serve clients with the highest standards of professional competency and ethical conduct.

The certification framework addresses the critical gap in professional education and standards that has emerged as American families now hold over $500 billion in Bitcoin, yet fewer than one in five have proper inheritance plans for these digital assets. Unlike traditional investments held by banks or brokers, Bitcoin exists only as cryptographic keys, creating unprecedented challenges for estate planning practitioners who must bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and established legal frameworks.

The BEPC certification program is vendor-neutral, distinguishing it from custodial 'kits' tied to single wallet companies. This independence ensures that certified professionals can provide objective guidance based on client needs rather than vendor relationships, maintaining the highest standards of professional integrity while delivering optimal outcomes for clients. The program's development involved extensive peer review by ACTEC Fellows, past presidents, boutique estate planning practitioners with crypto experience, and academic experts in digital asset law.

The three-level certification structure provides clear pathways for professional development while recognizing different levels of expertise and specialization within the Bitcoin estate planning field. Each level builds upon previous knowledge while introducing advanced concepts and specialized applications that enable practitioners to serve increasingly sophisticated client needs and complex planning scenarios.
